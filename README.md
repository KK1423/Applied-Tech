My C++ projects with Code Blocks and mingW
Adventure game - A text based game with sentence parsing, but has an extremely small vocabulary and world.
dsaf           - The ScratchAPixel code from chapter one.
Gyazo download - A little script I wrote to batch download my images from gyazo.com.
Memleakcrash   - Me messing around with memory leaks, don't actually run, takes up all your memory.
randtest       - Originally started as a test for the random function, but ended up as much more.
Raytracer      - My Path Tracer. Run and type in number of samples. Output is a .ppm file, supported by Gimp and Photoshop.
rr             - Spare project to compile functions independently for troubleshoting,
SFML test      - Pathetic first try at coding a Path tracer.

Executables compiled using mingW 4.9.2, or mingW 4.8.3.
